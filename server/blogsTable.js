<p>
        This is my first blog post, I will be posting about web development and game development, I am not sure what else I will learn later on but I will also dump that here too.
</p>
<p>
        My next few posts will be dedicated to my current book that I am working on, it is a textbook about fullstack development. There will also be posts on my current game project called Gestalt Illusion that I will post here as well as a devlog.

        This blog was built by myself with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. The reason is that I want to keep it small and simple, just like any other markdown based static blog sites.
